* Project background:

  Keeping in line with Stay-at-home orders requires creativity, as sampling from the larger population isn’t very feasible. As such, we decided to do some home experiments with ordinary bottles to see how changing different explanatory variables might affect the success rate of flipping the bottles. A success is achieved if the bottle is flipped 360 degrees and lands upright. A failure is achieved when the bottle lands on any part other than the bottom. When collecting data on different variables, care was taken to avoid bias in the results of the data. We decided to alternate evenly between each condition, as opposed to collecting the first half of the sample with one condition and the second half with another condition. This was done to avoid the later part or parts of the sample from being overaffected by improvements in bottle flipping skill. Further, this method is superior because it doesn’t allow the bottle flipper to get the feel for one set of conditions over the course of flipping with those conditions many times in succession.

* Project Description:

  Our project is called “Flip bottle challenge” , we would like to do some discussion based on our data of flipping bottle experiment. 

* Type of hypothesis test:
  1. Chi-square test
  2. Paired Sample t-test
